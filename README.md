# Cookie Consent

This is a plugin for WordPress, created for Alpaga Agency, to manage the content and the style of your cookie-consent. This allows the user to add this plugin to any WordPress webPage and display your cookie consent popup as you see fit.

Disclaimer: The ACF field PRO is known to have a bug where: « A bug found in the logic for syncing field groups (from Local JSON) caused the imported fields to lose their children. ». In my case, this causes the plugin to not keep the custom field group created when transferring the plugin to another page wordpress as I don't have the logs to redowload the ACF Field PRO given by my internship supervisor. Therefore, there won't be any screenshot for this project.

## The difficulties

The main difficulty was to understand the logic of the creation of a simple plugin, especialy when the documentation isn't that big.

The second difficulty was to create something, in WordPress, that allows the user to change the style and the content through ACF Group Fields Customs Content.
